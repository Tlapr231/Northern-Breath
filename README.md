Our style of our website focuses on being a website that has a safe and comfortable feeling, to allow 
potential users to be able to trust our product. We chose Blue, Black, and White as the main colours for our 
company, as shown through the logo. The gradient on the pages gives a smooth effect allowing the user to feel 
comfortable, which is our goal. Our header is sticky not only for asthetics, but also to show that like our webpage,
Northern Breath will always be with you.
